# Overview

This directory contains scripts to convert tensorboard logs to dataframes (log_to_df.py) and plot the learning rate and loss against pre-training time (plot_from_df.py) to monitor the pre-training process. 

The code in log_to_df.py is by @theRealSuperMario (https://github.com/theRealSuperMario)

The other file is from Stella Verkijk.

Both files are in their original forms.
